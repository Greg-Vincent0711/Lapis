<h1>Lapis</h1>
<p>
    A Minecraft bot built around AWS Microservices and Minecraft-based tooling(lookup Cubitect and the Cubiomes Library).<br/>
    Lapis has an entire website(currently in the works) dedicated to it's inner workings and all the stats for fellow nerds.
    But generally, Lapis is meant to resolve a couple small annoyances I had while enduring my 
    annual two week Minecraft phase. Namely, having a consistent place to store coordinates that wasn't my camera roll, only to then have to manually delete a bunch of screenshots later.<br/>

    You can think of Lapis as the younger, more complex sibling to [this](https://github.com/Greg-Vincent0711/Multi-purpose-Bot-for-Python/blob/main/DIscordBotVer%231.py) earlier project I made with a friend.

If someone wants to use the C code I wrote together with Cubiomes
To use the lib and compile programs:
1. cd into external/cubiomes
2. run make
3. cd ../../SeedInfoFns
4. run make
